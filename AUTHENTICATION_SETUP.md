# Google & GitHub Authentication Setup

## ✅ What's Been Fixed

### 1. Google Sign-In Implementation
- ✅ Added Google Sign-In dependency (`google_sign_in: ^6.3.0`)
- ✅ Configured iOS Info.plist with CLIENT_ID and URL schemes
- ✅ Implemented `signInWithGoogle()` method in AuthController
- ✅ Added Google sign-in button handler in LoginScreen
- ✅ Enhanced sign-out to handle both Firebase and Google

### 2. GitHub Sign-In Implementation  
- ✅ GitHub authentication already implemented in AuthController
- ✅ GitHub sign-in button already working in LoginScreen
- ✅ Uses Firebase Auth GitHub provider with proper scopes

### 3. Configuration Files Updated
- ✅ iOS `Info.plist` configured with Google Client ID and URL schemes
- ✅ Android `google-services.json` already properly configured
- ✅ iOS `GoogleService-Info.plist` exists and is configured

## 🚀 How to Test

### Testing Google Sign-In:
1. Run the app on iOS or Android
2. Navigate to Login screen
3. Tap "Continue with Google" button
4. Complete Google OAuth flow
5. Should redirect to Dashboard on success

### Testing GitHub Sign-In:
1. Navigate to Login screen  
2. Tap "Continue with GitHub" button
3. Complete GitHub OAuth flow
4. Should redirect to Dashboard on success

## 📱 Platform Support

### iOS Configuration:
- ✅ Client ID added to Info.plist
- ✅ URL schemes configured for OAuth callback
- ✅ GoogleService-Info.plist present

### Android Configuration:
- ✅ google-services.json configured
- ✅ OAuth client IDs for Android included
- ✅ Package name matches (com.example.codeup)

## 🔧 Key Implementation Details

### AuthController Methods:
- `signInWithGoogle()` - Handles Google OAuth flow
- `signInWithGitHub()` - Handles GitHub OAuth flow  
- `signOut()` - Signs out from both Firebase and Google
- Enhanced error handling with user-friendly messages

### LoginScreen Updates:
- Google sign-in button now functional (was disabled)
- Added `_handleGoogleLogin()` method
- Maintains GitHub functionality
- Loading states for both providers

## 🔐 Security Features

### OAuth Scopes:
- **Google**: `email`, `profile` (basic user info)
- **GitHub**: `user:email`, `read:user` (email and profile)

### Error Handling:
- Firebase Auth exceptions caught and displayed
- User cancellation handled gracefully
- Network/connectivity errors shown to user
- Detailed logging for debugging

## 📋 Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **Add social login to Sign-Up screen** if needed
2. **Add Apple Sign-In** for iOS App Store compliance
3. **Add user profile picture** from social providers
4. **Implement account linking** for multiple auth methods
5. **Add biometric authentication** as secondary factor

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **Google Sign-In fails**: Check iOS Client ID in Info.plist
2. **GitHub Sign-In fails**: Verify Firebase GitHub provider setup
3. **OAuth callback fails**: Check URL schemes configuration
4. **Build errors**: Run `flutter clean && flutter pub get`

### Debug Commands:
```bash
flutter analyze
flutter pub deps
flutter doctor
```

## 📚 Dependencies Used
